# python-challenge

In this project I had to analyze and calculate data with two different CSV files. One was called **PyBank** and the other was **PyPoll**.

## PyBank

In this part of the project I was able to analyze and calculate:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

After doing this I was able to print the code in the terminal and extract it to a .txt file.

## PyPoll

In this part of the project I was able to analyze and calculate:

The total number of votes cast.

* A complete list of candidates who received votes.

* The percentage of votes each candidate won.

* The total number of votes each candidate won.

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Again, I was able to print the code in the terminal and extract it to a .txt file after I caught and fixed all the bugs.
